server name, server id, giveaway's message id, giveaway's author, giveaway's winner (when it's over), giveaway's prize
to request a deletion of your data, please send me an email at the address below: Lopimakee@gmail.com
I will answer you as soon as possible
Master Giveaway's hardly asks for any permissions on your server, if you have any problem with the permissions it has please email me at the above address
if a security vulnerability has been discovered in Master Giveaway's, do not exploit it. Send me an email as soon as possible so that I can identify it and fix it.
If a giveaway's was launched with something dangerous or mocking as prizes, the fault lies with the person who launched the giveaway's and not me.
Master Giveaway's requests "MANAGES_MESSAGES" permission to launch a giveaway's or a "giveaways" role
if you have a problem with the role giveaways example: a role already assigned to ping the people who participate in the giveaway's, this is also your fault
